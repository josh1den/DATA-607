## Assignment: Tidying and Transforming Data

### Introduction

For this assignment, we're given the below data and tasked with reading the file into R as a .CSV, preparing the data and performing a basic analysis comparing delay rates for two airlines:

### Loading the Data

First we load packages and read the data into R:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh1den/DATA-607/Projects/HW6/flights.csv"
raw_data <- read.csv(url, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

raw_data
```

### Cleaning the Data

```{r}
# remove na row
# rename first two columns
# convert blank airline rows to NA in order to fill
# pivot data on cities
# pivot data on arrival
# create total_flights, delay_pct column
# replace periods in cities with spaces

df <- na.omit(raw_data) |>
  rename(Airline =  X, Arrival = X.1) |>
  mutate(Airline = na_if(Airline, "")) |>
  fill(Airline, .direction = "down") |>
  pivot_longer(3:7, names_to = "City", values_to = "Total") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Arrival, values_from = Total) |>
  rename(on_time = 'on time') |>
  mutate(total_flights = on_time + delayed,
         delay_pct = round(delayed/(on_time + delayed) * 100,2),
         City = gsub("\\.", " ", City))

df
```
### Preparing the Data for Analysis

```{r}
total_flights <- df |>
  select(1, 3, 4) |>
  group_by(Airline) |>
  summarise(on_time = sum(on_time), delayed = sum(delayed), 
            total_flights = sum(on_time) + sum(delayed),
            delay_pct = round(sum(delayed)/
                                (sum(on_time) + sum(delayed)) * 100, 2))

total_flights
```
### Visualizing the Data

```{r}
# avg delay
b1 <- ggplot(total_flights, aes(x=Airline, y=delay_pct, fill=Airline)) +
        geom_bar(stat="identity") +
        labs(title = "Average Delay") +
        scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))

# total flights
b2 <- ggplot(total_flights, aes(x=Airline, y=total_flights, fill=Airline)) +
        geom_bar(stat="identity") +
        labs(title = "Total Flights") +
        scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))

grid.arrange(b1, b2, ncol=2)
```

*As we can see here, Alaska Air has nearly half as many flights as America West and a 2.5% higher delay percentage, but Alaska Air has lower percentages of delay in every city. Let's take a closer look*

```{r}
f1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Airline, y=delay_pct, fill=Airline)) +
        geom_bar(stat="identity") +
        labs(title = "Delay Pct") +
        facet_wrap(~ City)

f2 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=Airline, y=total_flights, fill=Airline)) +
        geom_bar(stat="identity") +
        labs(title = "Total Flights") +
        facet_wrap(~ City)

grid.arrange(f1, f2)
```

*As we can see here, although Alaska Air has lower delay percentages in each city than America West, the Phoenix market is weighing the overall total, as Phoenix holds each airlines lowest delay rate and America West dramatically outbalances Alaska in terms of total number of flights from Phoenix.*
