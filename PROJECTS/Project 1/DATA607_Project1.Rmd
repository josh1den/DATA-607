## Introduction

In this project, we take chess tournament results data from a text file and prepare it for export as .csv

## Strategy

My strategy for this project was to identify the individual steps I needed to take to transform the data from the original text file.

The steps I identified to complete:  
1. Removing |'s and -'s  
2. Isolating the player names and ratings into their own columns  
3. Extracting the second row of data for each observation and   adding them as additional columns to each observation.  
4. Calculating the opposing player rating by match in order to aggregate an average.  

## Data Cleaning

The first step was to read the data into R. I tried several methods: first, table.read(), then read.tsv(), then I tried to read each individual line of the file into a new file. I ultimately discovered I could use read.csv, and through the arguments sep, header, skip, and colnames, I could achieve several of my cleaning goals in one line of code:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh1den/DATA-607/Projects/tournamentinfo.txt'
cols = c('player_num','name','total_pts','round_1','round_2','round_3','round_4',
         'round_5','round_6','round_7','NA')
df <- read.csv(url, sep="|", header=FALSE, skip=3, col.names=cols)
head(df)
```

The next step was to remove the rows with dashes.

```{r}
# remove rows with dashes
dashes <- "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
df <- filter(df, player_num != dashes)
head(df)
```

Next, I decided to create two new dataframes which I would later merge to one. The first dataframe (df1) would contain the odd number rows, and the second dataframe (df2) would contain the even number rows.

```{r}
# extract every first row
df1 <- df %>%
  filter(row_number() %% 2 == 1)

# extract every second row
df2 <- df %>%
  filter(row_number() %% 2 != 1)
```

Next I used regex to extract the player rating from the name column as a new column: rating. The player ratings all followed a : followed by two or three spaces, and were digits of a minimum length of 3, maximum length of 4.

```{r}
df2 <- df2 %>%
  mutate(rating = as.numeric(str_extract(name, "(?<=:\\s|:\\s\\s)\\d{3,4}")))
head(df2)
```

Now I could rename the player_num column to its appropriate name, state, and by subsetting, remove the columns I don't need.

```{r}
# rename and drop unnecessary columns
df2 <- rename(df2, state=player_num)
df2 <- df2[c("state","rating")]
head(df2)
```

Now I'm ready to merge the dataframes.

```{r}
# merge the dataframes
df_new <- merge(df1, df2, by.x = 0, by.y = 0)
head(df_new)
```
Steps 1, 2, and 3 are now basically complete. However, there is a little bit of tidying up to attend to. 

```{r}
# remove undesired columns
cols_to_remove <- c("Row.names","NA.")
df_new <- select(df_new, -cols_to_remove)
head(df_new)
```

```{r}
# the name column appears to have whitespace, let's trim that
df_new$name <- str_trim(df_new$name, side = c("both"))
head(df_new)
```
```{r}
# player_num column needs to be numeric
df_new$player_num <- as.numeric(df_new$player_num)
head(df_new)
```
Now to complete the final step: calculating the average opposing player ratings. 

First I start by extracting the player IDs from the round columns.

```{r}
# reduce round columns to only the player player_ids
round_cols <- c("round_1","round_2","round_3","round_4", "round_5", "round_6", "round_7")

for (col in round_cols) {
  df_new[[col]] <- as.numeric(str_extract_all(df_new[[col]], "(?<=\\s)\\d{1,2}", simplify=TRUE)) 
}

head(df_new)
```
Next, I iterate through the round columns, replacing the player IDs with the player rating corresponding to the player ID.

```{r}
# loop through the rounds replacing the opposing player id with the opposing player's pre-rating
for (row in 1:nrow(df_new)) {
  for (col in round_cols) {
    rating <- df_new[row, col]
    
    if(!is.na(rating)) {
      df_new[row, col] <- df_new$rating[df_new$player_num == rating]
    }
  }
}

head(df_new)
```
Now that I have columns with each opposing player rating, I can create a new columns with the average of the values in the round columns.

```{r}
## calculate avg opponent rating
df_new$avg_opposing_rating <- round(rowMeans(df_new[round_cols], na.rm=TRUE))

head(df_new)
```
From here, it's simply a matter of selecting the desired columns for my output file.

```{r}
# select the desired output
final <- select(df_new, c(2, 11, 3, 12, 13))
head(final)
```
Writing the file to csv:

```{r}
path <- "/Users/joshiden/Documents/Classes/CUNY SPS/Fall 2022/DATA 607/Projects/Project 1.csv"
write.csv(final, path)
```

Thanks!
