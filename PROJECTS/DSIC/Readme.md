Hi everybody,

Today I'm presenting an overview on collaboration using GitHub.

Before I begin, how many here have collaborated on projects in GitHub prior to this program? If you could please raise your hand using the "Reactions" button at the bottom of the screen.

And of those of you have experience collaborating in GitHub, how many would consider yourselves experts? Show of hands.

(if people raise hands)
Well this is great, thanks everyone. Those of you with experience, I'm going to come back around at the end of my presentation with some questions for you and I'd love your feedback and participation.

If you didn't raise your hand, you're just like me. Before this program I'd never collaborated on a project in GitHub. I've worked independently in GitHub, using repositories for storage, so I decided to use the opportunity here with this presentation to spend this time diving a little deeper into GitHub and opening up this space in our meeting today to learn more about this really essential tool for developers.

So, diving right in.

Slideshow

**What is Git?**
I'm just going to briefly introduce a couple foundational concepts here.

Git is a version control system, run through the command line or terminal. The vast majority of developers use git for version contrl.

**Why is Version Control Important**
It's the fundamental core of product development - documenting, tracking, and managing changes is critical to deploying effective and reproducable code and maintaining code integrity.

**What is GitHub**
GitHub is a cloud-based repository service built on Git.

GitHub is used by developers of all sorts, a couple quick stats:
- 337 programming languages
- over 1m projects in Python

This graphic is as of 2018. What's glaringly missing from here? R!
The best info I was able to find about R usage in GitHub is from 2014, where
R was ranked 12th most used programming languages in GitHub as far as active repositories. (https://githut.info/).

**Why GitHub**
As you'll see in this presentation, GitHub offers powerful tools integrating some of the most powerful and familiar features from widely used applications in a user-friendly interface which promotes open-source development.

**New to GitHub?**
If you're new to using GitHub, the first place to start is the documentation.
For our more experienced classmates, as I go through this presentation, please share any resources in the chat that you found useful, and at the conclusion of the presentation I'll add these links to my slides.

Closing:

So now one of the things I'd like to come back around and ask some of those
in the group with GitHub experience, is or are there specific resources that
you found valuable on your way to working in GitHub just "making sense" -- if there are, go ahead and drop them in the chat or feel free to chime in on audio.

I think to a large degree a lot of this stuff is "learn by doing", and one of my hopes with this presentation is anyone on the less experienced side of
the GitHub will come out a little more comfortable and with some resources for further learning.
