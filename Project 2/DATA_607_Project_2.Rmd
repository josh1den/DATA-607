### Project 2

The goal of this assignment is to practice preparing untidy datasets for downstream analysis.

Load packages:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr) 
library(readxl)
```

#### Dataset 1

For the first dataset, I chose the following data selected by Jhalak Das [source:](https://gist.github.com/Kimmirikwa/b69d0ea134820ea52f8481991ffae93e#file-student_results-csv):

![](/Users/joshiden/Downloads/untidydata.png)

Read the file into R:

```{r}
file <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh1den/DATA-607/Projects/Project%202/jhalak_das_untidy.csv"
df1 <- read.csv(file)
head(df1)
```

```{r}
# split up sex and age
# test column to single int
# pivot term columns to single column, term, column: grade

df1_clean <- df1 |>
  separate(col=sex.and.age, into=c("sex","age"), sep="_", convert=TRUE) |>
  rename(test = test.number) |>
  mutate(test = as.integer(str_extract_all(test, "([0-3])"))) |>
  pivot_longer(cols=c("term.1","term.2", "term.3"), names_to="term",
               names_pattern="([0-3])", values_to = "grade") |>
  arrange(name)

df1_clean
```

What is the average test score by area code (which also happens to be by student)?

```{r}
# average test score by area code

area_code <- df1_clean |>
  group_by(name, phone) |>
  summarize(avg_test_score = mean(grade)) |> 
  arrange(desc(avg_test_score))

area_code
```

Finally, saving the clean dataframe to .csv for later use.

```{r}
path1 <- "/Users/joshiden/Documents/Classes/CUNY SPS/Fall 2022/DATA 607/DATA-607/Project 2/df1_clean.csv"
write.csv(df1_clean, path1)
```

#### Dataset 2

For the second datasest, I chose data that I found and provided from the [National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/arts-data-profile-series/adp-31) comparing median income for arts with the overall U.S. Labor Force:

![](/Users/joshiden/Downloads/1data.png)

This data was challenging, as it existed only in .xlsx format. As such, I decided to the data into R using readxl.

```{r}
# read file in from local machine
filepath <- "/Users/joshiden/Documents/Classes/CUNY SPS/Fall 2022/DATA 607/DATA-607/Project 2/Table1aArtistProfile.xlsx"
# read sheet names
sheets <- excel_sheets(filepath)
df2 <- read_excel(filepath, sheet=sheets[1], skip=1)
head(df2)
```

This analysis focuses on comparing median income between different types of artists with the overall U.S. Labor Force, so I determined to select the observations needed, which also allowed me to eliminate NA rows and columns. I also determined that the desired data would need to go from wide to long format, as the columns all represented observations I am interested in. However, in order to pivot, I needed to define the first column.

```{r}
# get the desired column names
colnames <- colnames(df2)

# create the list of desired column names 
cols <- toupper(colnames(df2)) |>
  replace(1, "DEMOGRAPHIC")

# re-read the sheet
df2 <- read_excel(filepath, sheet=sheets[1], skip=3, col_names=cols)

# extract desired rows
df2_transformed <- df2[17:20,]
head(df2_transformed)
```

Now that the data exists in a structure I can work with, I write the file to .csv and upload to GitHub in order to work with the file as a .csv per the project instructions, and read the new .csv file into R.

```{r}
filepath <- "/Users/joshiden/Documents/Classes/CUNY SPS/Fall 2022/DATA 607/DATA-607/Project 2/artistearnings.csv"
write.csv(df2_transformed, filepath, row.names=FALSE)

# read csv from GitHub
gh_csv <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh1den/DATA-607/Projects/Project%202/artistearnings.csv"
df2t <- read.csv(gh_csv)
head(df2t)
```

Data tidying:

```{r}
# replace value names in demographic column
df2t$DEMOGRAPHIC <- df2t$DEMOGRAPHIC |>
  replace(1, "MEDIAN") |>
  replace(4, "RATIO") |>
  toupper()

# dancers column to integer
df2t$DANCERS.AND.CHOREOGRAPHERS <- gsub("\\*", NaN, df2t$DANCERS.AND.CHOREOGRAPHERS) |>
  as.integer()

# pivot long
df2t_pivoted <- df2t |> 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:14, names_to="TYPE", values_to="MEDIAN_INCOME") |>
  filter(DEMOGRAPHIC == "MEDIAN") |>
  select(2:3) |>
  arrange(desc(MEDIAN_INCOME))
  
head(df2t_pivoted)
```

Saving the pivoted data for further analysis,

```{r}
path2 <- "/Users/joshiden/Documents/Classes/CUNY SPS/Fall 2022/DATA 607/DATA-607/Project 2/df2_clean.csv"
write.csv(df2t_pivoted, path2)
```

Now I plot the data comparing median artist income by type with the overall U.S. Labor Force:

```{r}
ggplot(df2t_pivoted, aes(x=reorder(TYPE, MEDIAN_INCOME), y=MEDIAN_INCOME)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "TYPE")
```

#### Dataset 3

For the third dataset, I chose data selected by Seung Min Song:

![](/Users/joshiden/Downloads/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-09%20at%203.43.02%20PM.png)

This data was pretty straightforward, with the goal of comparing admissions by gender:

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh1den/DATA-607/Projects/Project%202/seungminsong_das_unitdy.csv"
df3 <- read.csv(url)

head(df3)
```

This data required simple pivoting to achieve the desired output:

```{r}
df3_pivoted <- df3 |>
  pivot_longer(cols=c("Admitted", "Rejected"), names_to="Admit",
               values_to="Count") |>
  group_by(Gender, Admit) |>
  summarize(Total = sum(Count))

df3_pivoted
```

Writing the pivoted data to file:

```{r}
path3 <- "/Users/joshiden/Documents/Classes/CUNY SPS/Fall 2022/DATA 607/DATA-607/Project 2/df3_clean.csv"
write.csv(df3_pivoted, path3)
```

Visualizing the admitted and rejected outcomes by gender:

```{r}
ggplot(df3_pivoted, aes(x=Admit, y=Total, fill=Gender)) +
  geom_col(position="dodge")
```
